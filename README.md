# Not A Forum

Hides everything that stays visible even if the user doesn't have "View forum" permission.

This extension is meant to be used with Flamarkt, but can also be used without it.

It doesn't hide stuff that can be hidden by disabling Flarum core extensions.

Make sure the permissions are correctly set, because this extension only affects visual elements and none of the permissions.

If the permissions aren't correctly setup users might still be able to post via the REST API.
